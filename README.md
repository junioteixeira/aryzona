## How to add to your server

Aryzona is not public yet.

## How to self host 

_The bot is written in GoLang, so you need the Go compiler._

Create a `config.yml` file and copy the content of the `config.example.yml` file into it.

Then, fill the config with proper values.

To start the bot, run `make run` or `go run .`.
